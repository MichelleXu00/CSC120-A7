- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

I need to remember to put all the parameters in the constructor of the parent class to that of the subclass. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Everything looks ok. I am not sure if I need to use try-catch in this assignment.
